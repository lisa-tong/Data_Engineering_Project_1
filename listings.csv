Thank you!","Your Airbnb stay comes with one parking spot underground.  The subway station ( St. Claire West) is a 5 minute walk and there is a bus stop and a streetcar platform within the block.  During the summer months, you have access to my bike.  The best way to get to my house from the airport is to take a taxi direct or rent a car. Toronto does not have the best public transit from the airport, but it is possible to take the bus. The closest subway is St. Claire West and walk 3 minutes to the condo. Alternatively, you can get to me from St Claire station and to take the street car to the Spadina Road Stop and walk up (North) three blocks.",You will have access to the entire condo.,"I do not stay at the condo.
